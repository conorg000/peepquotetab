# peepquotetab
Open a new tab, get a quote


At the moment, this Chrome plugin gives you a fresh Peepshow (UK TV series) meme every time you open a new tab.

In the future, I plan for it to:
- get the image URLs in a more automatic way
- have some user input which allows the user to choose a series' quotes to be fetched (Seinfeld would be great)
